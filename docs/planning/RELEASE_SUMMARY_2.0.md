- Provide next steps

### 2. Post-Publishing Monitoring

After publishing, you should:

1. Test the installation on a fresh system:

   ```bash
   npm install -g claude-self-reflect@2.0.0
   claude-self-reflect setup
   ```

2. Monitor for issues:

   - Check GitHub Issues page
   - Watch npm download stats
   - Be ready to publish patches if needed

3. Update any external documentation or announcements
